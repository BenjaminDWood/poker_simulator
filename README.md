A side project simulating a single game of poker, originally as an excuse to practice using Python's random module.

Version 1 would run through a game with customisable players, dealing a hand to each player, before burning and dealing the flop, turn, and river as they would be dealt in a real game.
Version 2 has focused on the setup of the game, allowing for more user-friendly customisation through inputs.

This is very much a side project that has helped me get to grips with certain elements of coding in Python. As such, any further work will be sparse for the foreseeable future.


Later versions would add:

   A win-checker in order to automatically determine the winner of any game.
  
   A betting system.
