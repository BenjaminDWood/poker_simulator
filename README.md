Project aims to create a working simulation of a single game of poker.
Currently, the code will run through a game with customisable players, dealing a hand to each player, before burning and dealing the flop, turn, and river as they would be dealt in a real game.

Further to this, I would like to add a win-checker to print who is the winner of each game.
Adding a betting system would be an interesting later project, but not something I'm prepared to spend time on currently.
